1-
npx create-react-app amplifyapp
cd amplifyapp
npm start

2-
init github repo

created repo amplify-react-graphql in github
push an existing repository from the command line 

git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"

Push the application to the new GitHub repo :

git remote add origin https://github.com/taniaherrerop/amplify-react-graphql.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

3-
Deploy to AWS Amplify

we have the app runing in  AWS amplify


4-
Edit src/App.js , mache changes

git add .
git commit -m “changes for v2”
git push origin main

--in aws amplicy will se in hosting env the pipeline ci/cd runing, when finish see the app updated 
--------------

5-
Install and configure the Amplify CLI

npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
amplify configure
us-east-1
user name: amplify-user  -->create user in iam, get sectret/accesskey,(download) then copy om the prompt
profile name:amplify-user 

 
 6-  
 Add Authentication

We will need two Amplify libraries :
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react --save

create the authentication service:
amplify init

Anwser:
Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory
? Enter a name for the project amplifyapp
The following configuration will be applied:

Project information
| Name: amplifyapp
| Environment: dev
| Default editor: Visual Studio Code
| App type: javascript
| Javascript framework: react
| Source Directory Path: src
| Distribution Directory Path: build
| Build Command: npm.cmd run-script build
| Start Command: npm.cmd run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes
Using default provider  awscloudformation
? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use amplify-user
Adding backend environment dev to AWS Amplify app: d3mhqlgwpunhf4

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

Some next steps:
"amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
"amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify push" to deploy everything


7-amplify add auth

? Do you want to use the default authentication and security configuration? Default configuration
? How do you want users to be able to sign in? Username
? Do you want to configure advanced settings? No, I am done.

Anwser:
✅ Successfully added auth resource amplifyapp4bb0011d locally

✅ Some next steps:
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

8- Deploy teh auth service
amplify push --y

To configure our app with these resources modify src/index.js

import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';
import config from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(config);

9- 
Add auth flow:

in src/App.js -->add the code in documentattion

we've used the withAuthenticator component. This component will scaffold out an entire user authentication flow allowing users to sign up, sign in, reset their password, and confirm sign-in for multifactor authentication (MFA). We have also added a Sign Out button to log users out.

10-
Run the app locally:



npm audit fix --force
amplify push
npm run start

Create Account (in Amplify app)
user: taniahoscarlitos@gmail.com 
pass:tthhpp2008

11-
configure the Amplify build process to add the backend as part of the continuous deployment workflow

amplify console
? Which site do you want to open? AWS console

This will open the Amplify console. From the navigation pane, 
choose App settings > Build settings and modify it to add the backend section (lines 2-7 in the code below) 
to your amplify.yml. After making the edits, choose Save.

amplify pull --appId d3mhqlgwpunhf4 --envName dev
... continue with docs

git add .
git commit -m “added auth”
git push origin main


create service role para amplify
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/how-to-service-role-amplify-console.html
in  aws amplify, select this role


modify code ans submit to github, wait the deployment and resfresh page ex: https://main.dajdesh7o5c33.amplifyapp.com/
